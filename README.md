# bioimpedance-analysis
This is a repo containing analysis of my bioimpedance data measured from my Xiaomi scale
# The data
I imported this data from my Xiaomi Scale. I manually wrote each day the data measured in the morning and work in Python to create insights over the data.
# 7-day average
I work the data to make an average over the last 7 days for each day, because these types of measurements inherently carry a lot of uncertainty an error.
# Visualizations
I used Seaborn to make graphs about the data. We can see the evolution of my weight, going down over time, and my muscle rate going up in that time. We can also see there is a clear correlation between my basal metabolic rate and my muscle mass.
